The Ford-Johnson (Merge-Insertion) Sort Algorithm is a specialized sorting technique designed to minimize the number of comparisons needed during the sorting process. Developed by Lester Ford Jr. and Selmer M. Johnson in 1959, this algorithm has historically set the standard for low-comparison sorting and continues to be a foundational concept in sorting algorithm research.

#### Steps of the Algorithm:

1. **Determine Array Length:**
   - Check if the given array has an odd or even length.
   - If odd, identify and set aside the last element as a 'straggler' to be inserted later.

2. **Create Pairs:**
   - Arbitrarily divide the sequence into pairs of two values.
   - Implement the `createPairs` function to structure the data into pairs.

3. **Sort Each Pair:**
   - Perform bitwise sorting on each pair to ensure the order is [less, greater].
   - Utilize the `sortEachPair` function for this bitwise sorting operation.

4. **Sort by Larger Value:**
   - Recursively sort all pairs based on the value of their largest element.
   - Implement the `sortLargerValue` function for this recursive sorting operation.

5. **Create Sequences 'S' and 'pend':**
   - Create the 'main' sequence 'S' by extracting the highest value of each pair.
   - The remaining values form a temporary array 'pend.'

6. **Build Jacobsthal Sequence:**
   - Based on the length of 'pend,' generate a sequence of valid Jacobsthal numbers using the `buildJacobInsertionSequence` function.

7. **Insert Elements into 'S':**
   - Iterate through the elements in 'pend' and, using the Jacobsthal insertion sequence, perform binary search insertions into 'S.'
   - Optimize insertions to leverage the efficiency of binary search.

8. **Handle Straggler (if present):**
   - If a 'straggler' was set aside in step 1, perform a binary search insertion for the straggler into the final sorted array 'S.'

9. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Track the number of comparisons made during the sorting process for efficiency estimation.
   - Optionally, perform a time duration test to measure the algorithm's execution speed.

10. **Return Sorted Array:**
    - The final result is the sorted array 'S.'

#### Conclusion:

Despite its complexity and relatively slower computational performance for larger datasets, the Ford-Johnson Merge-Insertion Sort Algorithm provides valuable insights into optimal sorting algorithms, especially for smaller datasets where the reduction in comparisons is a priority.
